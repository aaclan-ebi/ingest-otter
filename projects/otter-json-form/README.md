## Why `Otter` ?

It sounds like the  `AUDR`  (Add, Update, Delete, Read) and this is a json schema form builder library which allows users to interact with JSON data.

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.9.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project otter-json-form` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project otter-json-form`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project otter-json-form` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build otter-json-form` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build otter-json-form`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/otter-json-form` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test otter-json-form` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
